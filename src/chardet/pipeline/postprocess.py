"""Stage 13: post-processing rank corrections.

After statistical scoring produces a ranked list of candidates, a chain
of rank corrections fixes up the ranking when bigrams alone are
insufficient — see :func:`postprocess_results` for the order.  The steps:
dead-heat priors (superset preference, era prevalence), rare-language
arbitration (ADR-0005), confusion-group resolution (delegated to
:mod:`chardet.pipeline.confusion`), niche Latin demotion, KOI8-T
promotion, classic-Mac line-ending promotion, and last of all the
decode-safety flip, which hands a winner whose only multi-byte evidence
is an undecodable trailing sequence to the best rival that can decode
the caller's complete input.

Note: ``from __future__ import annotations`` is intentionally omitted because
this module is compiled with mypyc, which does not support PEP 563 string
annotations.

    Two questions, cheapest first.  Does *data* contain any byte the
    candidate decodes differently from ISO-8859-1?  If not, the data is
    equally valid under both encodings, nothing at the byte level favors
    the candidate, and it is demoted.

    If such bytes are present, do they favor the candidate?  Presence
    alone is symmetric evidence: a Windows-1252 file whose only non-ASCII
    letter is an ``Ö`` carries 0xD6, which HP-Roman8 reads as ``ø``, so
    both candidates "contain" the byte and the question is which reading
    holds up.  That is a confusion-style arbitration between the candidate
    and its swap target on the distinguishing bytes alone (see
    :func:`~chardet.pipeline.confusion.arbitrate_distinguishing_bytes`),
    each side scored under the variant that actually won its slot.  The

    the Welsh model knows that bigram and the Windows-1252 reading is a
    ``ð`` no Welsh model has seen.  When the models are silent, word shape
    decides: a Kven ``đ`` keeps a Finnish file on ISO-8859-10 because a
    letter between letters beats the superscript ``¹`` Windows-1252 reads
    there.  A lone ``Ö`` mid-word decides nothing either way, and the more
    prevalent encoding takes the evidence-free tie.

    The arbitration is only asked when the candidate's lead over the swap
    target is within :data:`~chardet.pipeline.confusion.CONFUSION_BAND`.
    A win by more than the band was decided on the full statistics, and
    re-litigating it on a handful of bytes is neither sound nor free: the

# the Celtic code page) was standardized in 1998 but Celtic text lived in
# latin-1 and moved to UTF-8; this project's wild-page mining has found no
# native specimen, and web surveys place the encoding at noise level.  The
# one documented genuine niche — Irish gettext .po catalogues that declare
# ISO-8859-14 (Scannell's vim/gettext translations, in the test suite) —
# measures safely outside the arbitration gate: genuine Celtic text has no
# prevalent-language rival anywhere near it.  Revision protocol per
# ADR-0005: any new genuine specimen goes into test-data and forces a
# re-audit of the set.  The set itself is :data:`chardet.models.RARE_LANGUAGES`
# — one definition, used by this gate and by the language fill's thin-margin
# band, so the two can never drift apart.  Membership changes happen there.

    Byte-validity filtering runs incremental decoders with ``final=False``,

    input is often a prefix of a larger whole.  When chardet examined the
    caller's *entire* input, that tolerance can hand back an encoding the
    caller's very next ``data.decode()`` will reject --- a four-byte
    ``iso-8859-1`` word ending in ``0xE1`` detected as utf-8 (issue #380).

    *input_truncated* is False --- the tail can actually hold a
    dangling sequence (a high byte in the final four, multi-byte winner),
    and the winner's tolerant decode is **non-empty pure ASCII** --- its
    only multi-byte evidence is the dangling tail itself.  An empty
    tolerant decode (the whole input is one clipped sequence) is zero
    evidence, not ASCII evidence, and disqualifies the flip.  The
    best-ranked rival that decodes the input completely under both its
    internal and public names then takes the top slot, regardless of the
    confidence gap: an all-ASCII-evidence winner detected nothing the
    rival did not also detect, and any statistical lead it holds comes
    from ASCII bigrams the rival matched equally well.  The scan sees the
    ranking as given, which under ``full_ranking=False`` is pruned; if no
    listed rival decodes, the winner stands (measured across a 648-case
    accent-final sweep, the pruned ranking always carried a decodable
    rival).

    The pure-ASCII condition is what makes the unconditional flip safe.  A
    short mid-character CJK cut has a correct answer that cannot decode the
    input --- flipping it to whichever single-byte codec happens to decode
    the bytes trades a right answer for a wrong one, and a 5-40 byte sweep
    measured exactly that under a gap-based rule (34 correct CJK answers
    lost, Big5 becoming cp1125).  Such a winner has decoded real multi-byte
