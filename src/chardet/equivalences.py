"""Backward-compatibility shim for ``chardet.equivalences``.

This module's contents were split in chardet 7.5: accuracy-evaluation tables
and predicates moved to :mod:`chardet.evaluation`, and public-API encoding-name
remapping moved to :mod:`chardet.output_names`.  This module proxies every
attribute to whichever of those two now owns it, so existing callers keep
working.

.. deprecated:: 7.5
    Import from :mod:`chardet.evaluation` (``is_correct``,
    ``is_equivalent_detection``, ``is_language_equivalent``, ``SUPERSETS``,
    ``BIDIRECTIONAL_GROUPS``, ``LANGUAGE_EQUIVALENCES``) or
    :mod:`chardet.output_names` (``apply_compat_names``,
    ``apply_preferred_superset``, ``apply_legacy_rename``,
    ``PREFERRED_SUPERSET``) instead.
    Will be removed in chardet 8.0.
