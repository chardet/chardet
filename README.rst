    someotherfile: ascii with confidence 1.0

About
-----

This is a continuation of Mark Pilgrim's excellent chardet. Previously, two
versions needed to be maintained: one that supported python 2.x and one that
supported python 3.x.  We've recently merged with [Ian Corduscano](https://github.com/sigmavirus24)'s
[charade](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/charade) fork, so now we have one
coherent version that works for Python 2.6+.
