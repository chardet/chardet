			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Couldn&#8217;t sleep in today since they were having renovations upstairs at 9am and I got out of bed at 10pm. Decided to go to 飲茶 with my dad, so we drove to Tsuen Wan. I had a near fatal accident. After that we drove to ssp, and I had another near fatal accident in which I didn&#8217;t stop in time and nearly crashed into the car in front. The car behind narrowly missed me as well.</p>
	<p>I then had my annual dental check up.</p>
	<p>Then I applied for an International Driving Licence&#8230; ironic&#8230;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>The end of term is approaching fast and I don&#8217;t know whether to be happy or not. It just doesn&#8217;t feel like the end yet. Perhaps for the whole semester I&#8217;ve been joking around, not doing any work whatsoever&#8230; Anyway, I am glad that I will be going back to Hong Kong soon, and hopefully I can still find most of my Bristol peeps when they go back as well.</p>
	<p>Many things happened this term, some of which left an amazing memory while some I hoped they never happened. But, having said that, I&#8217;ve learnt a lot more than I did before. The way I am meant to think, the way I am meant to act&#8230; I sacrificed a lot for this I guess, and it could have been won in a better and less harmful way&#8230; but I am still glad that I learnt something from it. Better gaining something by losing something than not gaining anything at all, right? There are a few people that I really want to thank but&#8230; I don&#8217;t really want to do it on the blog&#8230; it&#8217;s already corny enough.</p>
	<p>I don&#8217;t know how to write this, but I&#8217;d like to apologize to anyone I&#8217;ve hurt over this sem. Yeah, you could say I am thinking too much again, but this is exactly what I feel right now, and I know who I&#8217;ve hurt, and they probably know who they are. This isn&#8217;t a plead to be forgiven, but genuinely an apology. By doing some really really thoughtless things, I hope I&#8217;ve learnt something, and I won&#8217;t end up doing the same thing and hurting more people.</p>
	<p>All in all though, I can&#8217;t really express how much I love Bristol, no matter how hard the times were during this sem. There were always support from all of you&#8230; even Roland <img src='http://unoriginalblog.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> . I just hope that this can continue forever and forever. Unfortunately, I know it won&#8217;t. I think I have around 3 years time to really enjoy myself&#8230; and I want to make the most of this&#8230; and I hope all my friends can too&#8230; Without you guys, and girls, Bristol wouldn&#8217;t be the same. Cheers~ <img src='http://unoriginalblog.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
	<p>It might be the end of term&#8230; but it&#8217;s definately a start for something else~

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Finally I can be bothered to update my blog&#8230; it&#8217;s been a while and lots of things have happened&#8230; but none of them were bad&#8230; yes sorry to have disappointed any of you who wanted to read about the screams and embarassments I&#8217;ve made recently. Well, you can&#8217;t say there weren&#8217;t any embarassments but none of them would leave you laughing&#8230; in fact I don&#8217;t think any of them were funny&#8230;</p>
	<p>Lots of tests have gone by. Just had an aircraft systems test&#8230; it&#8217;s like learning aircraft history&#8230; interesting but I hate history. Never liked it. Never will. Don&#8217;t think I did that well on the test&#8230; I have another one this afternoon but that&#8217;s going to be even harder&#8230; Fluids test&#8230; what the hell. I haven&#8217;t done anything for it.</p>
	<p>One thing I am pissed off is how lazy I&#8217;ve gotten over last year. The gap year screwed me over and a half&#8230; Oh well&#8230;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Haven&#8217;t done much these days apart from waiting to go back to Hong Kong. I played loads of Gundam Seed recently at Unite House&#8230; kicking Lionel&#8217;s ass hahahaha. Then having to do reports after reports after revision after reports&#8230; well it felt that way anyway. I only got 17/27 in my Electronics test&#8230; what the hell&#8230; And tonight I was going to watch a film but instead I am going to have to do Maple&#8230; what the hell&#8230;</p>
	<p>But then the good thing is my ankle is getting better and better and better&#8230; I think I can play football next week, wahahaha. So happy. Haven&#8217;t played for ages. I hope our team wins the Bristol Games on the 8th of December&#8230; although it&#8217;ll be freezing cold I&#8217;ll still be playing&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
	<p>Already 1pm&#8230; time for lunch&#8230; then time for Buckling labs&#8230; = more reports&#8230;</p>
	<p>Lucky that the afternoon drawing session tomorrow afternoon is off.
